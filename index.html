                    In response to God’s commission to His people in Matthew 28:19–20, Gethsemane Bible-Presbyterian
                    Church
                    (GBPC) has established Mission Churches in other countries by sending and supporting brethren who
                    are
                    given the solemn burden to reach out to their fellow countrymen, share the Gospel with them, and
                    lead
                    them to a saving knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
                    <p>
                        By God’s grace, five mission churches were established in the Philippines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first mission church in the Philippines was inaugurated on 18 July 2004 in Cebu City. Rev
                        Reggor
                        Galarpe, who was ordained in 2007, has diligently cared for the flock that God has brought to
                        GBPC, Cebu
                        City. Despite various personal and ministerial challenges, the Lord has enabled Pastor Reggor to
                        provide
                        pastoral leadership and to oversee the ministries in Cebu City, Bohol, Bogo and San Antonio. Two
                        other
                        ministries, namely Gethsemane Bible Institute (GBI, Cebu) and The Gethsemane Care Ministry
                        (TGCM), were
                        also established in Cebu City.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second mission church was established in Bohol, a nearby island southeast of Cebu, on 6 July
                        2006.
                        Preacher Edsel has been leading the flock at this mission church since its inauguration.
                    </p>

            </div>


            <p>
                The third and fourth mission churches were established in Bogo and San Antonio, in northern Cebu, in
                2008 and 2009 respectively. Eld Eliezer Ortega has been leading these two sister churches since their
                pioneering preacher, the late Pr Dominino dela Cruz, Jr., was called to his eternal rest in July
                2013.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fifth mission church, in Dagupan City, Pangasinan near Manila, was established by the Lord in 2014,
                under the pastoral care of Rev Donald dela Cruz.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let us continue to uphold all these mission churches in the Philippines regularly in prayer for their
                continued labour in the Lord’s vineyard.

            <h2 class="section-title">Mission Trip 2025 : Cebu City, Bogo, San Antonio</h2>
            <p>
                The team for Mission Cebu 2025 in Cebu City, Bogo, and San Antonio (M25) departed from Changi Airport
                on Tuesday, 5 August 2025, at 8:20 a.m., and arrived at Mactan Airport, Cebu, at 12:05 p.m. the same
                day. The return flight was on Sunday evening, 10 August, with the team arriving back in Singapore just
                past midnight on Monday. In total, the team spent six days and five nights in Bogo and Cebu City.
            </p>
            <p>
                To God be the glory for the great things He had done through this small band of His frail and feeble
                children,entrusting them with the solemn responsibility of proclaiming His Word to many in Cebu City,
                Bogo, and San Antonio, and encouraging fellow brethren in the churches He has established there.
            </p>
            <p>

            </div>

            <b class="subtitle">A Spiritual Display of God’s Providence</b></br>
            The mission trip was a profound spiritual experience, during which the Lord God Almighty’s goodness and
            empowerment, in providing and enabling at every stage of M25, were clearly evident.
            </p>
            <p>

                From the initial call to participate, through the months of preparation, in relishing the warm welcomes
                at every event over the 6-day mission, the unique encounters at a High School and at a Women’s
                Rehabilitation Center, the final send-off at Mactan Airport, and the touch down at Changi Airport -
                those experiences brought to mind a children’s chorus;
            <div class="verseContainer">
                <i>
                    “My God is so great, so strong and so mighty,</br>
                    There is nothing my God cannot do.”
                </i>
            </div>
            </p>
            <p>
                The Lord of the harvest taught and commanded His disciples to pray unto Him to send forth labourers into
                His harvest, which is both great and plenteous (Matt. 9:38; Luke 10:2). This call was impressed upon the
                hearts and minds of many in the Mission. All glory and thanks be to the Lord, who demonstrated His
                omnipotence in many ways, providing unforgettable lessons for His undeserving people, that they might
                draw nearer to Him in faith and service.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b class="subtitle">The Lord’s Perfect Timing</b></br>
                The Word of God reminds us, <i>“He hath made every thing beautiful in his time...” (Ecc. 3:11)</i>.
                Truly, it
                was the Lord’s almighty providence that determined the time and setting of the Mission and every event.
                When He chose to close one door, He graciously opened another. What began as moments of disappointment
                and concern for some, He turned into ceaseless days of rejoicing and thanksgiving for all. To be simply
                available and ready to seize opportunities that suddenly arose, whether in spreading the Gospel or in
                encouraging and comforting a needy soul, is a sobering yet grateful acknowledgment of the Lord’s
                all-powerful work.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b class="subtitle">God’s Provisions</b></br>
                It was certainly the moving of the Holy Spirit that touched the hearts of all who joyfully formed the
                Mission Team, despite the anticipated rigour and demands of the Mission. At first, the brief overview of
                the programme may have appeared daunting to some. Yet, with the comfort and assurance from God’s Word
                and prayer, 22 brethren quickly signed up for Mission 2025.

            <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2rem;">

            </div>

            Another sister from Cebu City, who is working in a very demanding profession here in Singapore, was able
            to secure two days of vacation leave prior to the National Day weekend. She flew to Cebu City as we
            arrived from Bogo, to join the Team. All praise be to the Lord for her involvement in sharing her
            testimony and for the way she related warmly with the women at the Rehabilitation Center. Among the 23
            brethren were 4 Elders, 2 Preachers, 2 Deacons, our Deaconess, as well as many well-trained sisters and
            several brothers who faithfully spread the Gospel and taught the children in the three mission churches.
            Truly, all glory and thanks be to Jehovah-Jireh, “the Lord who provides”.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b class="subtitle">God’s Empowerment</b></br>
                It is indeed of the Lord’s empowerment that all served with joy and enthusiasm. The Word of God reminds
                us;
            <div class="verseContainer">
                <i>
                    “Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts”
                </i>

                <p class="reference">
                    - Zechariah 4:6
                </p>
            </div>

            For indeed, who could have undertaken this work
            when we think of the task of sowing the Gospel seeds
            and encouraging of brethren among:
            <ul>
                <li> 20 children at San Antonio’s Outreach</li>
                <li>30 children at Bogo’s Outreach</li>
                <li>900 students and staff at Cebu Roosevelt Memorial Colleges (CRMC) High School in Bogo </li>
                <li>110 residents and staff at the Department of Health-Treatment & Rehabilitation Center (DOH- TRC)
                    in Cebu City, which supports women recovering from substance abuse </li>
                <li>60 children and 30 adults at two outreaches in a sister’s home in Cebu City </li>
                <li>12 homes ministering to 15 families of brethren, </li>
                <li>2 prayer meetings, at a weekly Fellowship meeting and at the TGCM meeting, in Cebu City</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b class="subtitle">Unity of the Brethren</b></br>
                The willingness of the brethren to serve made the trip both joyful and fruitful. Everyone carried out
                their tasks without needing reminders, and many went above and beyond what was normally expected. One
                example brings back a particularly blessed memory: the cheerful face of a preacher who shouldered a
                heavy box of around 10kg as he carried it from the coach to the hotel in Bogo. Many other physically
                strong brothers did the same, while the sisters responded faithfully to the less physically demanding
                tasks at each event.
            <div class="verseContainer">

            Truly, what we enjoyed throughout the Mission was
            a blessed experience. All glory be to the Lord.

            At the Bogo church, regardless of gender, age, or position, both local and visiting brethren packed 950
            evangelism gift sets within just one hour. During the outreach events in Cebu City, brethren from the
            host church spontaneously organised all physical arrangements, assisted the children joyfully, and
            prepared extra craft materials and refreshments whenever attendance exceeded expectations.

                        Though the ground was slippery from overnight showers, on 6 August—especially on the slopes
                        near
                        several
                        brethren’s homes in San Antonio—the Lord watched over every step our brethren took. On 9
                        August,
                        while
                        visiting the home of one of our brethren, a sister slipped during a steep descent where
                        railings
                        were
                        absent in some areas. Had the Lord not been with her, she could have been seriously injured.
                        How
                        gracious is the Lord in His deliverance!

                    <p>
                        Truly, His hand was upon us throughout the trip. For some, we are certainly aware of His
                        intervention.
                        For others, even when we did not know, His hand of protection was over us as we served,
                        travelled,
                        rested, and slept.

                        <b class="subtitle">God’s Power Over the Weather</b></br>
                        The Lord’s almighty power over the elements was a great encouragement to all in the Mission.
                        Although
                        the land we visited is highly prone to natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanic
                        eruptions,
                        storms, and typhoons, the gracious Lord demonstrated His providence by granting us excellent
                        weather.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On 5 August, while He sent heavy rain to sustain life and cool the earth in Cebu City, the
                        Mission Team
                        was already well on the 3½-hour journey to Bogo. Rain did arrive in Bogo on the early
                        morning of
                        6
                        August; however, it stopped just after breakfast, allowing the Team to begin serving
                        Him—some
                        teaching
                        the children in the church in San Antonio, and others visiting the homes of brethren there.
                        Later that
                        afternoon, after most were already under shelter, the rain resumed. What a joy it was to
                        have
                        pleasant,
                        cool weather as the Team went about their service.

                At other times, the weather remained dry, perfectly timed for the CRMC High School visit, the journey
                from Bogo to Cebu City on 7 August, and all the outreach activities on 9 August. God’s providence spared
                us from difficulties that rain could have caused, including treacherous slopes, outdoor shelters, and
                makeshift porches. Remarkably, heavy rain only fell after our programmes had ended for the day.

            <p>
                The programme also included participation in the prayer meetings at Bogo, San Antonio, and Cebu City,
                where we were mutually encouraged. The Mission Trip concluded with a prayer meeting with the Cebu
                brethren, followed by sweet fellowship over tea and ice cream at SM Mall.

            <h2 class="section-title">Mission 2025 Outreaches</h2>
            <p>
                As part of Mission 2025, the Lord graciously opened many doors for the Gospel in Cebu City, Bogo, and
                San Antonio. Among these, three key outreaches — at Cebu Roosevelt Memorial College (CRMC), the
                Department of Health – Treatment and Rehabilitation Center (DOH-TRC), and among the children in various
                mission stations — stood out as clear demonstrations of God’s providence and power. Each setting was
                different, but in all, the same unchanging message of Christ’s saving grace was proclaimed faithfully.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b class="subtitle">CRMC Outreach</b></br>
                At the Cebu Roosevelt Memorial College (CRMC) High School in Bogo, the Lord graciously opened a door
                that far exceeded expectations. What began as a plan to hand out Gospel tracts became a full-scale
                Gospel rally for nearly 1,000 students and staff, gathered in their new sports hall. The mission team
                proclaimed Christ through preaching the Gospel, personal testimonies, and songs of thanksgiving, and the
                Spirit of God worked mightily as the once noisy crowd turned attentive to the Word of Life. Each
                attendee received a copy of the Gospel of John, ensuring that the seed of God’s Word would continue to
                speak long after the event. Local leaders reminded us of the deep spiritual need in Bogo, a place yet to
                be fully reached with the message of salvation. This outreach was a vivid reminder that “the harvest
                truly is plenteous” (Matt. 9:37), and it impressed upon all present the urgency of fulfilling the Great
                Commission. Truly, the CRMC High School rally was a day of sowing abundantly, and we trust that in God’s
                perfect time, He will bring forth eternal fruit.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b class="subtitle">DOH-TRC Outreach</b></br>
                The outreach at the Department of Health – Treatment and Rehabilitation Center (DOH-TRC) in Cebu City
                was a moving testimony of Christ’s power to bring true freedom. About 70 women residents and 40 staff
                gathered to hear the Gospel through messages, testimonies, and small-group conversations. Many shared
                openly about their struggles, regrets, and hopes, and the mission team pointed them to the One who alone
                can forgive sins and give new life—the Lord Jesus Christ. One woman held a Bible tightly to her heart,
                exclaiming with joy that she finally owned God’s Word. Others received tracts and Gospel booklets with
                gratitude, their faces reflecting newfound hope. The words of John 8:36, “If the Son therefore shall
                make you free, ye shall be free indeed,” came alive in that place of confinement. We left with the
                assurance that the Gospel seed had been sown in tender soil, and we continue to pray that many will find
                lasting deliverance in Christ, whose grace abounds even to the least and the lost.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b class="subtitle">Children’s Outreach</b></br>
                The Children’s Outreach was a joyful display of God’s love for little ones. Across Bogo, San Antonio,
                Cebu City, and in the home of a sister, more than 160 children gathered to hear the Gospel through
                songs, Bible lessons, and crafts. Lessons specially prepared for them were brought to life with engaging
                illustrations, while the children responded with eagerness and delight. Though the venues were simple,
                each became a sacred place as the Word of God was faithfully taught and young voices lifted in praise.
                The parable of the sower reminds us that the seed of God’s Word, though scattered widely, will take root
                in some hearts and bring forth fruit in His time (Luke 8:11–15). The mission team’s prayer is that these
                children will not only remember the stories taught but will one day confess Christ as Lord and Saviour.
                We look forward in faith to the day when some of these young ones may even rise to labour in the Lord’s
                harvest, continuing the work of the Gospel in future generations.

                <b class="subtitle">Invitation to Join the Short-Term Mission Trip</b></br>
                The invitation for mature believers to join M25 was made in the Sunday Worship bulletin on 30 March
                2025. By 7 April, all vacancies were filled, and registration was closed earlier than planned. It was
                both thrilling and humbling to witness the Almighty moving the hearts of brethren to register for the
                trip within just one week.
            </p>
            <p>
                The leaders welcomed 23 participants (comprising five married couples, six brothers, and seven sisters)
                with much joy. Though half of the team members were in their senior years, they looked to the Lord for
                renewed strength to soar like eagles in M25:

                    “But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as
                    eagles;
                    they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint”.

                By God’s provision, all return tickets for the brethren were purchased by 20 April. As the Lord willed,
                the entire team boarded the same Scoot flight on 5 August.

            <p>
                <b class="subtitle">Assigning Roles</b></br>
                A Central Committee (comprising Eld Mah, Dn Gan, Bro Edward, Rev Reggor, Eld Eliezer, Bro Allan and
                later, Dn Samuel) was formed to plan and organise the trip. Eight subcommittees, each with a
                person-in-charge and an assistant, were also established by 24 April. Praise the Lord for His providence
                in raising these brethren, and for their willing acceptance of the roles assigned.
                At that point, we were 14 weeks away from the start of the mission trip. We prayed that the Lord would
                grant us His help and His joy as we prepared.

                    Accommodation and Inter-City Commutes
                </b></br>
                After weeks of intensive searching and evaluation, and with the help of Eld Eliezer (from Bogo church)
                and Bro Allan Ebarle (from our Cebu City church), accommodation in Bogo for the first two nights, and in
                Cebu City for the next three nights, was secured by 28 April.
                The coaches for the three inter-city commutes—Mactan Airport to Bogo on 5 August, Bogo to Cebu City on 7
                August, and Cebu City to Mactan Airport on 10 August—were also confirmed by the same date.
                Both Eld Eliezer and Bro Allan continued to work with Bro Edward to source for appropriate smaller
                vehicles for short trips within Bogo, San Antonio, and Cebu City. The mission churches also looked into
                providing meals for the team.
                Within a short period, the Lord had graciously provided for the team’s physical, necessary needs. The
                various function leaders then began to pray in earnest and to plan for the execution of their respective
                activities.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b class="subtitle">Music</b></br>
                Led by Bro Gideon, a small choir team was initially formed, aspiring to present the theme song “Look to
                the Lamb of God” at various meetings during the trip. Meanwhile, the whole mission team was scheduled to
                render a hymn of praise to the Singapore congregation on Sunday, 3 August, following the tradition of
                past mission trips.
                After further discussion, the Central Committee decided to take a simpler and more unified approach: the
                entire mission team would sing together on both 3 August and during the trip itself.
                We thank the Lord for 12 brethren who had earlier stepped forward to form the small choir—their
                willingness and enthusiasm encouraged others who are less musically inclined to join in joyfully as
                well.
                We also thank God for enabling Bro Chris, working with Dn Gan and Eld Low, to update the Mission Song
                Book to include Pastor Koshy’s recent compositions of both Scriptures-in-Song and Spiritual Songs and
                realignment of some pages for a more pleasant appearance.
                In addition, two new guitars purchased for use during home visitations and meetings, were gifted to the
                churches in Bogo/San Antonio and Cebu City.

                <b class="subtitle">Children’s Ministry
                </b></br>
                The Children’s Ministry, led by Dns Diana and Sis Luan Kheng, prepared to proclaim the Gospel to
                children through three outreach programmes, one at each mission church. Lessons were readied for both
                Lower and Upper Primary groups. The team also prepared to conduct Bible lessons at the Children’s
                Fellowship or Worship Service at the Cebu church.
                We praise God for the many brethren—too many to name—who, though not going on the trip, rendered help
                and resources for this preparatory work. Pr Cornelius prepared three special children’s lessons with
                illustrations for M25, while Sis Luan Kheng, with the help of other sisters, prepared the song sheets.
                Sis Kim Lei designed and sourced the craft materials and, with the help of other sisters, prepared them
                in readiness for the children’s activities in line with the lesson plan.
                Thanks be to our Omnipotent God for the safe delivery of items procured from overseas, despite delays
                caused by a typhoon.

                </b></br>
                The preaching schedule drawn up by Eld Mah, Dn Gan and Bro Edward were prompted by the leading of the
                Lord, to tap on the experience of Pr Samson and Pr Jeremiah, as well as the Elders. We thank God for His
                providence of four Elders to join this mission, allowing them to share the load of ministering God’s
                Word at eleven home visitations, prayer meetings at two mission churches, a Gospel meeting for adults,
                the weekly meeting with TGCM brethren, the Gospel Outreaches at DOH Treatment & Rehabilitation Center
                for Women in Cebu City, and at a high school in Bogo.

                <b class="subtitle">Evangelism and Visitation
                </b></br>
                Eld Choy and Dn Eng Huat together with Eld Mah, Dn Gan and Bro Edward, laboured much on the planning of
                the Gospel Outreach. We praise the Lord for their flexibility in adapting to changes and reorganising
                the programme as the Lord opened new doors: ministering to over 70 residents at the DOH-TRC for Women in
                Cebu City, and to 950 students and staff of a high school in Bogo.
                The team also prepared guidance on using the Gospel of John for personal evangelism.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b class="subtitle">Refreshments & Gifts
                </b></br>
                The Refreshments and Gifts subcommittee, comprising Sis Arlaine (Bogo church), Sis Marites (Cebu City
                church), Sis Magdalene, and Sis Peggy, took charge of preparing refreshments for fellowships and
                outreach meetings, as well as gifts for home visits.
                Enabled by God’s provision and the generosity of many brethren, the team prepared for distribution of
                some meaningful gifts, across the three cities, comprising:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    200 KJV Bibles

            Bro Chris as part of the Publications subcommittee played a significant role, where he designed the logo
            for M25, worked diligently on the layout of both the updated Mission Songbook and the Mission Team
            Handbook. The Publications subcommittee, led by Eld Low and Bro Chris, with the help of Dn Gan,
            finalised the layout and arranged the printing of 140 songbooks, and also worked with Dn Gan’s daughter,
            Sis Chien Huey, who designed the evangelism pamphlets (in the form of tent-desk calendars), of which
            1,300 copies were printed. They later managed the various post-mission trip communication tools,
            including the materials used for the Thanksgiving Gathering on 23 August, the Report of the Mission in
            both printed and e-formats and a video montage.

                <b class="subtitle">Logistics</b></br>
                Besides all the work associated with securing appropriate accommodation, air travel, intercity and
                intracity road travel, the Logistics effort included key activities in handling the movement of
                voluminous luggages and boxes safely from Singapore to the various intended destinations, and transiting
                through Immigration and Customs efficiently. All glory to the Lord for His providence of Bro Allan, who
                with his knowledge of the clearance process and associations, enabled a smooth transit.
                By the afternoon of 28 July, a week before the departure on the early morning of 5 August, the local
                Logistics Team (comprising Bro Edward and Eld Lim), with much help from Bro Cayson and cheerful support
                from Bro John Peh and Bro David Ng, completed the packing, weighing, and assigning of all M25 items.
                All glory to our bountiful God—16 packages (weighing 194 kg in total) were prepared for transfer to the
                mission stations. Special thanks to Bro Cayson, who volunteered to transport all items to the airport
                for check-in on 6 August.

                We praise the Lord for brethren in the team who gave generously and joyfully towards M25, supporting
                specific purchases and mission expenses. We also thank God for moving the hearts of others not on the
                trip to contribute financially.
                May the Lord continue to stir more brethren to give cheerfully to the cause of missions, remembering His
                command:

            <b class="subtitle">Spiritual Preparation
            </b></br>
            Eld Mah reminded us that the single most important preparation was prayer. He periodically circulated
            prayer items and updates so that we could render both supplication and thanksgiving to the Lord.
            At our final briefing via Zoom on 26 July, Rev Reggor joined us. He exhorted us to look to God, whose
            grace is sufficient for us (2 Cor 12:8–9) and urged us to look beyond our infirmities and weaknesses to
            God’s sustaining grace, which alone enables us to serve Him.
            I was deeply encouraged by Rev Reggor’s joyful disposition during the session, despite his increasing
            physical pain and imminent medical treatment.

                <b class="subtitle">Setting of the Programme
                </b></br>
                By early May, the Central Committee had proposed visiting a public high school in Bogo, and a Treatment
                & Rehabilitation Centre (TRC) in Cebu City.
                In late June, approval was received for the TRC visit. Then, on 1 July, permission was granted to
                conduct an outreach at a public high school in Bogo, including distribution of tracts and magazines to
                800 students in their classrooms, and preaching to 60 senior high students.
                On 8 July, news came that Cebu Roosevelt Memorial College (CRMC), the high school involved, had an
                enrollment of 930 students, including 320 seniors. The Evangelism subcommittee revised its programme to
                minister to all.
                By 28 July, the school confirmed the availability of its new amphitheatre-style sports complex, allowing
                us to minister to the entire student body and staff—of almost 1,000 people!
                Indeed, our Omnipotent God directs and moves in mysterious ways. Eld Mah had reminded us earlier that we
                serve such a God, and that we must lift up our eyes to the harvest, as Christ commands in John 4:35.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b class="subtitle">Send the Light</b></br>
                May our Almighty God energise this team to shine His Gospel light. May He, in His ceaseless mercy, pour
                out His grace upon many souls in Bogo, San Antonio, and Cebu City, and move them to receive the Lord
                Jesus as their Saviour.
                I have dwelt long on the preparatory work, because I was deeply enthralled by our Lord’s leading—opening
                opportunities, equipping the team, and providing abundantly for His work.

                            faith in the Lord by Rev Reggor, his family and Cebu GBPC brethren.
                            2. Approval from the respective authorities in our seeking of:

                            cheer through this practical way of giving to brethren and non-believers in these foreign

                            children. Some are procured from overseas vendors. None is damaged despite the cargo passage
                            through the South China Sea being delayed by the typhoon. Thanks to our Omnipotent God!

                            9. In our preparation for the mission trip, we could look to God for His sufficient grace,
                            His strengthening grace, His enabling grace, His sustaining grace to see us working for His

                            students and staff! (If I had not been encouraged by Rev Reggor’s exhortation 3 evenings
                            ago, I would receive this news with much apprehension instead of exhilaration.)
