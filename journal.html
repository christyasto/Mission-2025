                        <p>Though half of the team members are in our senior years, the leaders encouraged us to look
                            to the Lord for renewed strength to soar like the eagles in M25; "But they that wait upon
                            the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall
                            run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint" ( Isa 40:31).

                            Thank God for His provision for the physical arrangement for the team.
                            Eld Eliezer (from Bogo GBPC) has secured hotel accommodation for us for the first 2 nights
                            in Bogo, and the subsequent 3 nights in Cebu City was sourced and confirmed by Bro Edward
                            after an intensive search.</p>
                        <p>The coaches for 3 inter-city commutes are booked:
                            Mactan Airport to Bogo on 5 Aug,
                            Bogo to Cebu City on 7 Aug and
                            Cebu City to the Mactan Airport on 10 Aug are booked.
                            Smaller vehicles (Jeepneys) will be sourced for the shorter trips within the city in Bogo,
                            San Antonio and Cebu City.</p>
                        <p>The mission churches have agreed to source for the meals for the team.
                            The CCom advised that the Mission Fee of S$650 is to be paid in 2 installments by 31 May and
                            30 June. The fee will cover accommodation, inter-city and intra-city transport and meals, as
                            well as any evangelistic material (e.g. tracts and art and craft work for children) and
                            gifts for the home visits and participants of our outreach programmes. All surplus funds
                            will be channelled back to the Lord's work in Cebu, Bogo and San Antonio.</p>
                        <p>A program overview was shared for our use in planning. It is a fast-paced and busy 6-day
                            program. May the Lord grant us much strength and joy to serve Him, and the Lord's gracious
                            bestowment of much spiritual blessings in souls being saved and hearts drawn closer to Him.
                            His be the glory for all things.

                        past mission trips. The arrangement will be simplified, and there will be a practice session

                            We are now exactly 1 week away from our departure for Cebu.

                            John booklets.</p>
                        <p>Eld Mah reported that the flooring of the meeting place designated for our ministering to
                            the ~320 high school students in the CRMC is completed; it is actually a sports complex
                            designed like an amphitheatre which allows us to minister to the entire school of ~950
                            students and staff! (If I had not been encouraged by Rev Reggor's exhortation 3 evenings
                            ago, I would receive this news with much apprehension instead of exhilaration.)
                            Oh, Praise to our marvellous God. Indeed our Lord God Omnipotent moves in mysterious ways.
                            As He directs, His people cannot but follow in His step.</p>
                        <p>The Evangelistic team will have to quickly redesign the outreach program towards holding a
                            Gospel Rally to minister to the students and staff of the school. May God grant the
                            Evangelistic team much wisdom.

                            Eld Mah, at some earlier junction, exhorted the team with our Master's piercing word, "Say
                            not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up
                            your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest" (John 4:35).
                            I think the team is ready for the trip with the Lord's guidance.
