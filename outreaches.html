            <p>
                As part of Mission 2025, the Lord graciously opened many doors for the Gospel in Cebu City, Bogo, and
                San Antonio. Among these, three key outreaches — at Cebu Roosevelt Memorial College (CRMC), the
                Department of Health – Treatment and Rehabilitation Center (DOH-TRC), and among the children in various
                mission stations — stood out as clear demonstrations of God's providence and power. Each setting was
                different, but in all, the same unchanging message of Christ's saving grace was proclaimed faithfully.
            </p>

                <b class="subtitle">CRMC Outreach</b></br>
                At the Cebu Roosevelt Memorial College (CRMC) High School in Bogo, the Lord graciously opened a door
                that far exceeded expectations. What began as a plan to hand out Gospel tracts became a full-scale
                Gospel rally for nearly 1,000 students and staff, gathered in their new sports hall. The mission team
                proclaimed Christ through preaching the Gospel, personal testimonies, and songs of thanksgiving, and the
                Spirit of God worked mightily as the once noisy crowd turned attentive to the Word of Life. Each
                attendee received a copy of the Gospel of John, ensuring that the seed of God's Word would continue to
                speak long after the event. Local leaders reminded us of the deep spiritual need in Bogo, a place yet to
                be fully reached with the message of salvation. This outreach was a vivid reminder that "the harvest
                truly is plenteous" (Matt. 9:37), and it impressed upon all present the urgency of fulfilling the Great
                Commission. Truly, the CRMC High School rally was a day of sowing abundantly, and we trust that in God's
                perfect time, He will bring forth eternal fruit.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b class="subtitle">DOH-TRC Outreach</b></br>
                The outreach at the Department of Health – Treatment and Rehabilitation Center (DOH-TRC) in Cebu City
                was a moving testimony of Christ's power to bring true freedom. About 70 women residents and 40 staff
                gathered to hear the Gospel through messages, testimonies, and small-group conversations. Many shared
                openly about their struggles, regrets, and hopes, and the mission team pointed them to the One who alone
                can forgive sins and give new life—the Lord Jesus Christ. One woman held a Bible tightly to her heart,
                exclaiming with joy that she finally owned God's Word. Others received tracts and Gospel booklets with
                gratitude, their faces reflecting newfound hope. The words of John 8:36, "If the Son therefore shall
                make you free, ye shall be free indeed," came alive in that place of confinement. We left with the
                assurance that the Gospel seed had been sown in tender soil, and we continue to pray that many will find
                lasting deliverance in Christ, whose grace abounds even to the least and the lost.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b class="subtitle">Children's Outreach</b></br>
                The Children's Outreach was a joyful display of God's love for little ones. Across Bogo, San Antonio,
                Cebu City, and in the home of a sister, more than 160 children gathered to hear the Gospel through
                songs, Bible lessons, and crafts. Lessons specially prepared for them were brought to life with engaging
                illustrations, while the children responded with eagerness and delight. Though the venues were simple,
                each became a sacred place as the Word of God was faithfully taught and young voices lifted in praise.
                The parable of the sower reminds us that the seed of God's Word, though scattered widely, will take root
                in some hearts and bring forth fruit in His time (Luke 8:11–15). The mission team's prayer is that these
                children will not only remember the stories taught but will one day confess Christ as Lord and Saviour.
                We look forward in faith to the day when some of these young ones may even rise to labour in the Lord's
                harvest, continuing the work of the Gospel in future generations.
