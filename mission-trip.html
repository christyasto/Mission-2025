            <h2 class="section-title">Mission Trip 2025 : Cebu City, Bogo, San Antonio</h2>
            <p>
                The team for Mission Cebu 2025 in Cebu City, Bogo, and San Antonio (M25) departed from Changi Airport
                on Tuesday, 5 August 2025, at 8:20 a.m., and arrived at Mactan Airport, Cebu, at 12:05 p.m. the same
                day. The return flight was on Sunday evening, 10 August, with the team arriving back in Singapore just
                past midnight on Monday. In total, the team spent six days and five nights in Bogo and Cebu City.
            </p>
            <p>
                To God be the glory for the great things He had done through this small band of His frail and feeble
                children,entrusting them with the solemn responsibility of proclaiming His Word to many in Cebu City,
                Bogo, and San Antonio, and encouraging fellow brethren in the churches He has established there.
            </p>

            <b class="subtitle">A Spiritual Display of God's Providence</b></br>
            The mission trip was a profound spiritual experience, during which the Lord God Almighty's goodness and
            empowerment, in providing and enabling at every stage of M25, were clearly evident.
            </p>
            <p>

                From the initial call to participate, through the months of preparation, in relishing the warm welcomes
                at every event over the 6-day mission, the unique encounters at a High School and at a Women's
                Rehabilitation Center, the final send-off at Mactan Airport, and the touch down at Changi Airport -
                those experiences brought to mind a children's chorus;
            <div class="verseContainer">
                <i>
                    "My God is so great, so strong and so mighty,</br>
                    There is nothing my God cannot do."
                </i>
            </div>
            </p>
            <p>
                The Lord of the harvest taught and commanded His disciples to pray unto Him to send forth labourers into
                His harvest, which is both great and plenteous (Matt. 9:38; Luke 10:2). This call was impressed upon the
                hearts and minds of many in the Mission. All glory and thanks be to the Lord, who demonstrated His
                omnipotence in many ways, providing unforgettable lessons for His undeserving people, that they might
                draw nearer to Him in faith and service.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b class="subtitle">The Lord's Perfect Timing</b></br>
                The Word of God reminds us, <i>"He hath made every thing beautiful in his time..." (Ecc. 3:11)</i>.
                Truly, it
                was the Lord's almighty providence that determined the time and setting of the Mission and every event.
                When He chose to close one door, He graciously opened another. What began as moments of disappointment
                and concern for some, He turned into ceaseless days of rejoicing and thanksgiving for all. To be simply
                available and ready to seize opportunities that suddenly arose, whether in spreading the Gospel or in
                encouraging and comforting a needy soul, is a sobering yet grateful acknowledgment of the Lord's
                all-powerful work.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b class="subtitle">God's Provisions</b></br>
                It was certainly the moving of the Holy Spirit that touched the hearts of all who joyfully formed the
                Mission Team, despite the anticipated rigour and demands of the Mission. At first, the brief overview of
                the programme may have appeared daunting to some. Yet, with the comfort and assurance from God's Word
                and prayer, 22 brethren quickly signed up for Mission 2025.

            <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                <img src="sources/teamatcebu.jpg" alt="M25 team"

            </div>

            Another sister from Cebu City, who is working in a very demanding profession here in Singapore, was able
            to secure two days of vacation leave prior to the National Day weekend. She flew to Cebu City as we
            arrived from Bogo, to join the Team. All praise be to the Lord for her involvement in sharing her
            testimony and for the way she related warmly with the women at the Rehabilitation Center. Among the 23
            brethren were 4 Elders, 2 Preachers, 2 Deacons, our Deaconess, as well as many well-trained sisters and
            several brothers who faithfully spread the Gospel and taught the children in the three mission churches.
            Truly, all glory and thanks be to Jehovah-Jireh, "the Lord who provides".
            </p>
            <p>
                <b class="subtitle">God's Empowerment</b></br>
                It is indeed of the Lord's empowerment that all served with joy and enthusiasm. The Word of God reminds
                us;
            <div class="verseContainer">
                <i>
                    "Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts"
                </i>

                <p class="reference">
                    - Zechariah 4:6
                </p>
            </div>

            For indeed, who could have undertaken this work
            when we think of the task of sowing the Gospel seeds
            and encouraging of brethren among:
            <ul>
                <li> 20 children at San Antonio's Outreach</li>
                <li>30 children at Bogo's Outreach</li>
                <li>900 students and staff at Cebu Roosevelt Memorial Colleges (CRMC) High School in Bogo </li>
                <li>110 residents and staff at the Department of Health-Treatment & Rehabilitation Center (DOH- TRC)
                    in Cebu City, which supports women recovering from substance abuse </li>
                <li>60 children and 30 adults at two outreaches in a sister's home in Cebu City </li>
                <li>12 homes ministering to 15 families of brethren, </li>
                <li>2 prayer meetings, at a weekly Fellowship meeting and at the TGCM meeting, in Cebu City</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b class="subtitle">Unity of the Brethren</b></br>
                The willingness of the brethren to serve made the trip both joyful and fruitful. Everyone carried out
                their tasks without needing reminders, and many went above and beyond what was normally expected. One
                example brings back a particularly blessed memory: the cheerful face of a preacher who shouldered a
                heavy box of around 10kg as he carried it from the coach to the hotel in Bogo. Many other physically
                strong brothers did the same, while the sisters responded faithfully to the less physically demanding
                tasks at each event.
            <div class="verseContainer">
                <i>

                    brethren to dwell together in unity!"

            </div>
            Truly, what we enjoyed throughout the Mission was
            a blessed experience. All glory be to the Lord.

            At the Bogo church, regardless of gender, age, or position, both local and visiting brethren packed 950
            evangelism gift sets within just one hour. During the outreach events in Cebu City, brethren from the
            host church spontaneously organised all physical arrangements, assisted the children joyfully, and
            prepared extra craft materials and refreshments whenever attendance exceeded expectations.

                        Though the ground was slippery from overnight showers, on 6 August—especially on the slopes
                        near
                        several
                        brethren's homes in San Antonio—the Lord watched over every step our brethren took. On 9
                        August,
                        while
                        visiting the home of one of our brethren, a sister slipped during a steep descent where
                        railings
                        were
                        absent in some areas. Had the Lord not been with her, she could have been seriously injured.
                        How
                        gracious is the Lord in His deliverance!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Truly, His hand was upon us throughout the trip. For some, we are certainly aware of His
                        intervention.
                        For others, even when we did not know, His hand of protection was over us as we served,
                        travelled,
                        rested, and slept.

                <b class="subtitle">God's Power Over the Weather</b></br>
                The Lord's almighty power over the elements was a great encouragement to all in the Mission.
                Although
                the land we visited is highly prone to natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanic
                eruptions,
                storms, and typhoons, the gracious Lord demonstrated His providence by granting us excellent
                weather.
            </p>
            <p>
                On 5 August, while He sent heavy rain to sustain life and cool the earth in Cebu City, the
                Mission Team
                was already well on the 3½-hour journey to Bogo. Rain did arrive in Bogo on the early
                morning of
                6
                August; however, it stopped just after breakfast, allowing the Team to begin serving
                Him—some
                teaching
                the children in the church in San Antonio, and others visiting the homes of brethren there.
                Later that
                afternoon, after most were already under shelter, the rain resumed. What a joy it was to
                have
                pleasant,
                cool weather as the Team went about their service.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
                At other times, the weather remained dry, perfectly timed for the CRMC High School visit, the journey
                from Bogo to Cebu City on 7 August, and all the outreach activities on 9 August. God's providence spared
                us from difficulties that rain could have caused, including treacherous slopes, outdoor shelters, and
                makeshift porches. Remarkably, heavy rain only fell after our programmes had ended for the day.
            </p>
            <p>
                The programme also included participation in the prayer meetings at Bogo, San Antonio, and Cebu City,
                where we were mutually encouraged. The Mission Trip concluded with a prayer meeting with the Cebu
                brethren, followed by sweet fellowship over tea and ice cream at SM Mall.
