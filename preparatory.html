                <b class="subtitle">Invitation to Join the Short-Term Mission Trip</b></br>
                The invitation for mature believers to join M25 was made in the Sunday Worship bulletin on 30 March
                2025. By 7 April, all vacancies were filled, and registration was closed earlier than planned. It was
                both thrilling and humbling to witness the Almighty moving the hearts of brethren to register for the
                trip within just one week.
            </p>
            <p>
                The leaders welcomed 23 participants (comprising five married couples, six brothers, and seven sisters)
                with much joy. Though half of the team members were in their senior years, they looked to the Lord for
                renewed strength to soar like eagles in M25:
            <div class="verseContainer">

                    "But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as
                    eagles;
                    they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint".

                By God's provision, all return tickets for the brethren were purchased by 20 April. As the Lord willed,
                the entire team boarded the same Scoot flight on 5 August.

                <b class="subtitle">Assigning Roles</b></br>
                A Central Committee (comprising Eld Mah, Dn Gan, Bro Edward, Rev Reggor, Eld Eliezer, Bro Allan and
                later, Dn Samuel) was formed to plan and organise the trip. Eight subcommittees, each with a
                person-in-charge and an assistant, were also established by 24 April. Praise the Lord for His providence
                in raising these brethren, and for their willing acceptance of the roles assigned.
                At that point, we were 14 weeks away from the start of the mission trip. We prayed that the Lord would
                grant us His help and His joy as we prepared.
            </p>

                    Accommodation and Inter-City Commutes
                </b></br>
                After weeks of intensive searching and evaluation, and with the help of Eld Eliezer (from Bogo church)
                and Bro Allan Ebarle (from our Cebu City church), accommodation in Bogo for the first two nights, and in
                Cebu City for the next three nights, was secured by 28 April.
                The coaches for the three inter-city commutes—Mactan Airport to Bogo on 5 August, Bogo to Cebu City on 7
                August, and Cebu City to Mactan Airport on 10 August—were also confirmed by the same date.
                Both Eld Eliezer and Bro Allan continued to work with Bro Edward to source for appropriate smaller
                vehicles for short trips within Bogo, San Antonio, and Cebu City. The mission churches also looked into
                providing meals for the team.
                Within a short period, the Lord had graciously provided for the team's physical, necessary needs. The
                various function leaders then began to pray in earnest and to plan for the execution of their respective
                activities.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b class="subtitle">Music</b></br>
                Led by Bro Gideon, a small choir team was initially formed, aspiring to present the theme song "Look to
                the Lamb of God" at various meetings during the trip. Meanwhile, the whole mission team was scheduled to
                render a hymn of praise to the Singapore congregation on Sunday, 3 August, following the tradition of
                past mission trips.
                After further discussion, the Central Committee decided to take a simpler and more unified approach: the
                entire mission team would sing together on both 3 August and during the trip itself.
                We thank the Lord for 12 brethren who had earlier stepped forward to form the small choir—their
                willingness and enthusiasm encouraged others who are less musically inclined to join in joyfully as
                well.
                We also thank God for enabling Bro Chris, working with Dn Gan and Eld Low, to update the Mission Song
                Book to include Pastor Koshy's recent compositions of both Scriptures-in-Song and Spiritual Songs and
                realignment of some pages for a more pleasant appearance.
                In addition, two new guitars purchased for use during home visitations and meetings, were gifted to the
                churches in Bogo/San Antonio and Cebu City.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b class="subtitle">Children's Ministry
                </b></br>
                The Children's Ministry, led by Dns Diana and Sis Luan Kheng, prepared to proclaim the Gospel to
                children through three outreach programmes, one at each mission church. Lessons were readied for both
                Lower and Upper Primary groups. The team also prepared to conduct Bible lessons at the Children's
                Fellowship or Worship Service at the Cebu church.
                We praise God for the many brethren—too many to name—who, though not going on the trip, rendered help
                and resources for this preparatory work. Pr Cornelius prepared three special children's lessons with
                illustrations for M25, while Sis Luan Kheng, with the help of other sisters, prepared the song sheets.
                Sis Kim Lei designed and sourced the craft materials and, with the help of other sisters, prepared them
                in readiness for the children's activities in line with the lesson plan.
                Thanks be to our Omnipotent God for the safe delivery of items procured from overseas, despite delays
                caused by a typhoon.

                <b class="subtitle"> Preaching
                </b></br>
                The preaching schedule drawn up by Eld Mah, Dn Gan and Bro Edward were prompted by the leading of the
                Lord, to tap on the experience of Pr Samson and Pr Jeremiah, as well as the Elders. We thank God for His
                providence of four Elders to join this mission, allowing them to share the load of ministering God's
                Word at eleven home visitations, prayer meetings at two mission churches, a Gospel meeting for adults,
                the weekly meeting with TGCM brethren, the Gospel Outreaches at DOH Treatment & Rehabilitation Center
                for Women in Cebu City, and at a high school in Bogo.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b class="subtitle">Evangelism and Visitation
                </b></br>
                Eld Choy and Dn Eng Huat together with Eld Mah, Dn Gan and Bro Edward, laboured much on the planning of
                the Gospel Outreach. We praise the Lord for their flexibility in adapting to changes and reorganising
                the programme as the Lord opened new doors: ministering to over 70 residents at the DOH-TRC for Women in
                Cebu City, and to 950 students and staff of a high school in Bogo.
                The team also prepared guidance on using the Gospel of John for personal evangelism.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b class="subtitle">Refreshments & Gifts
                </b></br>
                The Refreshments and Gifts subcommittee, comprising Sis Arlaine (Bogo church), Sis Marites (Cebu City
                church), Sis Magdalene, and Sis Peggy, took charge of preparing refreshments for fellowships and
                outreach meetings, as well as gifts for home visits.
                Enabled by God's provision and the generosity of many brethren, the team prepared for distribution of
                some meaningful gifts, across the three cities, comprising:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    200 KJV Bibles
                </li>
                <li>2,000 booklets of the Gospel of John
                </li>
                <li>1,900 ballpoint pens
                </li>
                <li>950 highlighters
                </li>
                <li>300 children's Christian books and 52 adult books
                </li>
                <li>160 Bible Witness magazines
                </li>
                <li>Coloured pens and 17 practical grocery gift bags for families
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Bro Allan and his daughter, Sis Keren helped to purchase the Bibles, received the 2,000 Gospel booklets,
                and made arrangements to transport them to Bogo church before the team's arrival.

            Bro Chris as part of the Publications subcommittee played a significant role, where he designed the logo
            for M25, worked diligently on the layout of both the updated Mission Songbook and the Mission Team
            Handbook. The Publications subcommittee, led by Eld Low and Bro Chris, with the help of Dn Gan,
            finalised the layout and arranged the printing of 140 songbooks, and also worked with Dn Gan's daughter,
            Sis Chien Huey, who designed the evangelism pamphlets (in the form of tent-desk calendars), of which
            1,300 copies were printed. They later managed the various post-mission trip communication tools,
            including the materials used for the Thanksgiving Gathering on 23 August, the Report of the Mission in
            both printed and e-formats and a video montage.

                        Besides all the work associated with securing appropriate accommodation, air travel, intercity
                        and
                        intracity road travel, the Logistics effort included key activities in handling the movement of
                        voluminous luggages and boxes safely from Singapore to the various intended destinations, and
                        transiting
                        through Immigration and Customs efficiently. All glory to the Lord for His providence of Bro
                        Allan, who
                        with his knowledge of the clearance process and associations, enabled a smooth transit.
                        By the afternoon of 28 July, a week before the departure on the early morning of 5 August, the
                        local
                        Logistics Team (comprising Bro Edward and Eld Lim), with much help from Bro Cayson and cheerful
                        support
                        from Bro John Peh and Bro David Ng, completed the packing, weighing, and assigning of all M25
                        items.
                        All glory to our bountiful God—16 packages (weighing 194 kg in total) were prepared for transfer
                        to the
                        mission stations. Special thanks to Bro Cayson, who volunteered to transport all items to the

                trip to contribute financially.
                May the Lord continue to stir more brethren to give cheerfully to the cause of missions, remembering His

            Eld Mah reminded us that the single most important preparation was prayer. He periodically circulated
            prayer items and updates so that we could render both supplication and thanksgiving to the Lord.
            At our final briefing via Zoom on 26 July, Rev Reggor joined us. He exhorted us to look to God, whose
            grace is sufficient for us (2 Cor 12:8–9) and urged us to look beyond our infirmities and weaknesses to
            God's sustaining grace, which alone enables us to serve Him.
            I was deeply encouraged by Rev Reggor's joyful disposition during the session, despite his increasing
            physical pain and imminent medical treatment.

                <b class="subtitle">Setting of the Programme
                </b></br>
                By early May, the Central Committee had proposed visiting a public high school in Bogo, and a Treatment
                & Rehabilitation Centre (TRC) in Cebu City.
                In late June, approval was received for the TRC visit. Then, on 1 July, permission was granted to
                conduct an outreach at a public high school in Bogo, including distribution of tracts and magazines to
                800 students in their classrooms, and preaching to 60 senior high students.
                On 8 July, news came that Cebu Roosevelt Memorial College (CRMC), the high school involved, had an
                enrollment of 930 students, including 320 seniors. The Evangelism subcommittee revised its programme to
                minister to all.
                By 28 July, the school confirmed the availability of its new amphitheatre-style sports complex, allowing
                us to minister to the entire student body and staff—of almost 1,000 people!
                Indeed, our Omnipotent God directs and moves in mysterious ways. Eld Mah had reminded us earlier that we
                serve such a God, and that we must lift up our eyes to the harvest, as Christ commands in John 4:35.
