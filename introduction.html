                    In response to God's commission to His people in Matthew 28:19–20, Gethsemane Bible-Presbyterian
                    Church
                    (GBPC) has established Mission Churches in other countries by sending and supporting brethren who
                    are
                    given the solemn burden to reach out to their fellow countrymen, share the Gospel with them, and
                    lead
                    them to a saving knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
                    <p>
                        By God's grace, five mission churches were established in the Philippines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first mission church in the Philippines was inaugurated on 18 July 2004 in Cebu City. Rev
                        Reggor
                        Galarpe, who was ordained in 2007, has diligently cared for the flock that God has brought to
                        GBPC, Cebu
                        City. Despite various personal and ministerial challenges, the Lord has enabled Pastor Reggor to
                        provide
                        pastoral leadership and to oversee the ministries in Cebu City, Bohol, Bogo and San Antonio. Two
                        other
                        ministries, namely Gethsemane Bible Institute (GBI, Cebu) and The Gethsemane Care Ministry
                        (TGCM), were
                        also established in Cebu City.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second mission church was established in Bohol, a nearby island southeast of Cebu, on 6 July
                        2006.
                        Preacher Edsel has been leading the flock at this mission church since its inauguration.
                    </p>

            </div>


            <p>
                The third and fourth mission churches were established in Bogo and San Antonio, in northern Cebu, in
                2008 and 2009 respectively. Eld Eliezer Ortega has been leading these two sister churches since their
                pioneering preacher, the late Pr Dominino dela Cruz, Jr., was called to his eternal rest in July
                2013.
            </p>
            <p>
                The fifth mission church, in Dagupan City, Pangasinan near Manila, was established by the Lord in 2014,
                under the pastoral care of Rev Donald dela Cruz.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let us continue to uphold all these mission churches in the Philippines regularly in prayer for their
                continued labour in the Lord's vineyard.
            </p>
